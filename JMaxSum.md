java library for the max-sum algorithm

# Introduction #

jmaxsum is a java library for solving factored and decentralized optimization problems using the max-sum algorithm. The code is based on the factor graph representation of a factored function.

# Details #

JMaxSum implements the standard max-sum algorithm and the bounded max-sum approach.
The implementation is based on an abstraction of the two operators (max and sum) hence it should be fairly easy to extend the implementation with different operators (e.g., min-sum, sum-product, etc,).
